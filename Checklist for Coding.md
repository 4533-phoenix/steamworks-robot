* Check to see if the code gives any errors that will crash the robot.


* Check if the arduino is plugged in.
  * Check if lidar is plugged in.
  * Check if Pixy is plugged in.
  * Check if Gyro is plugged in.
* Check if Ultrasonic is plugged in.
* Check if Gear Sensor is plugged in.
  
  

* Check to see if the wheels turn in the right direction or move at all.
* Check to see if left and right joysticks are inverted.
* Check for speed gradient.
* Make sure the seed for the speed gradient is equal to or under 10.
* Check to see if ramping is working.


* Test all buttons to see if they do the right functions.
  * O (Circle) Button controls climber (fast)
  * [] (Square) Button controls climber (slow)
  * If shooter is attached:
    * R2 Button Controls agitator
    * R1 Button Controls shooter
  * L1 Button is the speed up button


* Check to see if the sensors are emmiting the right values.
  * Lidar and Ultrasonic should be giving a distance reading.
  * Pixy should be giving left right or straight.
  * Gear Sensor should be true or false.
  * Gyro should give us the angle we are at.


* Test Autonomous.
  * Make sure the wheels are turning the correct direction.
